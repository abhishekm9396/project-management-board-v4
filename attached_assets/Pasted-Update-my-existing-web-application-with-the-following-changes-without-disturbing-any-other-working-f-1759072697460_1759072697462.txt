Update my existing web application with the following changes without disturbing any other working functionality.

Context

Sections in the app: Dashboard, Kanban Board, Agile Story Board, Notifications.
Roles: Admin, Team Lead, User (all must be able to access and use both boards with their current role permissions).



Required Modifications

1️⃣ Kanban Board

Redesign and refactor to follow a Kanban workflow:

Implement Work-In-Progress (WIP) limits per column.
Support continuous flow (no sprint timebox).
Metrics: capture lead time and cycle time.
Cards can represent any work item (task, bug, enhancement).
Ensure it remains fully functional for all 3 roles.

2️⃣ Agile Story Board

Redesign and refactor to follow a Scrum/Agile sprint-based workflow:

Cards represent user stories with tasks/sub-tasks.
Enable sprint creation, start, and end dates.
Include metrics: velocity and burndown charts.
No WIP limit requirement.
Accessible and usable by Admin, Team Lead, and User roles.



3️⃣ Story Card Enhancements (Apply to Both Boards)

Make the following fields mandatory: Story Type, Priority, Story Points, Status, Assignee, Active Sprint.
Set default value for Status as “Backlog”.
Provide user name suggestions (auto-complete / dropdown) in Assignee based on existing users.
Ensure each story card:

Adjusts to page zoom level dynamically.
Supports vertical scrolling if card content exceeds available height.



Critical Instructions

Do NOT modify: existing backend APIs, database schema, authentication, notifications, or any other working features outside these two boards.
Maintain role-based permissions as currently implemented.
Preserve all existing data and history of boards.
If a backend endpoint must be touched (only if unavoidable), clearly document it and avoid breaking existing contracts.



Output Needed

Updated frontend UI design (responsive) and frontend code changes (React/Angular/etc., depending on current stack).
Clear list of any minor backend adjustments (if absolutely required).
