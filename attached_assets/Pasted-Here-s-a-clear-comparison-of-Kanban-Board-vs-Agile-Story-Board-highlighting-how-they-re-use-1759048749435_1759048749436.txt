Here‚Äôs a clear comparison of **Kanban Board** vs **Agile Story Board**, highlighting how they‚Äôre used in project management and software development:

| **Aspect**          | **Kanban Board**                                                                                                   | **Agile Story Board**                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | Visualize **continuous workflow** and limit work in progress (WIP) to improve flow and efficiency.                 | Visualize **sprint-based user stories** and tasks during an Agile/Scrum sprint to track progress.                                   |
| **Process Focus**   | Focuses on **flow of work**: tasks move continuously from ‚ÄúTo Do‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúDone,‚Äù with no fixed timebox. | Focuses on **iterations (sprints)**: user stories are planned for a sprint (usually 1‚Äì4 weeks) and tracked until sprint completion. |
| **Timeframe**       | No fixed iteration; work is pulled as capacity allows. Continuous delivery.                                        | Bound to a sprint (timeboxed). Work is completed within the sprint duration.                                                        |
| **Work Items**      | Cards represent any type of work item: bug, task, enhancement, etc.                                                | Cards represent **user stories**, which are broken down into tasks.                                                                 |
| **WIP Limits**      | Strong emphasis on **WIP limits** to avoid bottlenecks and ensure smooth flow.                                     | WIP limits are not mandatory; sprint backlog defines capacity.                                                                      |
| **Typical Columns** | To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review/Testing ‚Üí Done (can be customized).                                                   | Backlog ‚Üí To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Done (reflecting sprint stages).                                                          |
| **Metrics**         | Measures **lead time** and **cycle time** (how long it takes for a task to move across the board).                 | Measures **velocity**, **burndown charts**, and sprint goal completion.                                                             |
| **Flexibility**     | Very flexible, can be used for support/maintenance work where priorities shift often.                              | More structured; tied to the Scrum framework and sprint planning.                                                                   |
| **Ownership**       | Team pulls work when ready. No strict roles required.                                                              | Scrum roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team) manage and monitor progress.                                            |
| **When to Use**     | Best for **continuous flow projects** like operations, support, or ongoing product development.                    | Best for **sprint-based projects** where work is defined and prioritized for each sprint.                                           |

### Key Takeaways

* **Kanban Board** = Continuous, flow-based, WIP-focused.
* **Agile Story Board** = Sprint-focused, story/task tracking for Agile/Scrum.

üëâ In practice, **both boards look visually similar** (columns and cards), but their **mindset and metrics differ**: Kanban is about **flow & limits**, while an Agile Story Board is about **planning & delivering stories within a sprint**.
